# Apuntes
Hi!, This is the repository in which I store my notes on the degree of mathematics and physics at Polytechnic University of Catalonia.

Feel free to use the .pdf files for self-study or the .tex and .svg files to create more content.

If you have some corrections, modifications or comments, please, do not hesitate in contact me. 


## Setup
---
This is my setup for writting TeX Files:
- vim with the vimtex plugin () to edit the TeX files.
- Inkscape for the vector graphics.
- UltiSnips plugin for the use of snippets in vim
